# Planning Poker Frontend-Only Application

## Objective
Build a comprehensive Planning Poker application similar to planningpokeronline.com using only frontend technologies, enabling teams to conduct agile estimation sessions with real-time collaboration, voting mechanisms, and session management without requiring a traditional backend server.

## Implementation Plan

   - Status: Not Started

2. **Real-time Communication Infrastructure**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: CRITICAL DECISION POINT - Choose between WebRTC peer-to-peer, Firebase Realtime Database, Supabase, or Pusher for real-time sync
   - Files: Communication service layer, connection management, error handling, reconnection logic
   - Status: Not Started

3. **State Management System**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Complex state management for rooms, users, votes, stories, timers - consider Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or Context API
   - Files: Store configuration, reducers/actions, state interfaces, middleware for persistence
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Core UI Component Library**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Reusable components following atomic design principles, accessibility compliance
   - Files: Card components, Button library, Modal system, Layout components, Form elements
   - Status: Not Started

5. **Room Management System**
   - Dependencies: Task 2, 3, 4
   - Notes: Room creation with unique codes, joining mechanism, participant management, moderator controls
   - Files: Room creation flow, join room flow, room settings, participant list management
   - Status: Not Started

6. **User Story Management**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, 4
   - Notes: CRUD operations for stories, story queue management, story details and descriptions
   - Files: Story creation forms, story list components, story detail views, story navigation
   - Status: Not Started

7. **Voting Mechanism Core**
   - Dependencies: Task 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Notes: Multiple card deck support (Fibonacci, T-shirt, custom), vote collection, reveal/hide logic
   - Files: Card selection interface, vote submission logic, vote reveal animations, consensus calculations
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Timer and Session Controls**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, 7
   - Notes: Estimation timers, round management, session flow control
   - Files: Timer components, session state management, round transition logic
   - Status: Not Started

9. **Data Persistence Layer**
   - Dependencies: Task 3
   - Notes: Local storage for session recovery, IndexedDB for complex data, export/import functionality
   - Files: Storage utilities, data serialization, backup/restore mechanisms
   - Status: Not Started

10. **Statistics and Reporting**
    - Dependencies: Task 7, 9
    - Notes: Vote statistics, estimation history, consensus tracking, export capabilities
    - Files: Statistics calculation, chart components, export utilities, reporting dashboard
    - Status: Not Started

11. **Mobile Responsiveness and PWA**
    - Dependencies: Task 4
    - Notes: Mobile-first design, touch interactions, offline capability, app-like experience
    - Files: Responsive CSS, PWA manifest, service worker, mobile-specific components
    - Status: Not Started

12. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
    - Dependencies: All previous tasks
    - Notes: Unit tests, integration tests, real-time communication testing, cross-browser compatibility
    - Files: Test suites, test utilities, mock services, CI/CD configuration
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- Users can create and join rooms using unique codes
- Real-time synchronization works across multiple browser tabs/devices
- Voting process completes successfully with reveal/hide functionality
- Session data persists across browser refreshes
- Application works on mobile devices with touch interactions
- All estimation scales (Fibonacci, T-shirt sizes, custom) function correctly
- Statistics and consensus tracking provide accurate results
- Application handles network disconnections gracefully
- Performance remains smooth with multiple concurrent users
- Accessibility standards are met for inclusive usage

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Real-time Synchronization Complexity Without Backend**
   Mitigation: Implement WebRTC with fallback to third-party real-time services like Firebase or Supabase for reliable communication

2. **Data Consistency Across Multiple Users**
   Mitigation: Implement conflict resolution strategies, use operational transformation techniques, and provide clear visual feedback for sync status

3. **Scalability Limitations in Peer-to-Peer Architecture**
   Mitigation: Design for small to medium teams (5-15 people), implement connection management strategies, consider hybrid approaches for larger groups

4. **Browser Compatibility and Feature Support**
   Mitigation: Comprehensive browser testing, progressive enhancement approach, polyfills for missing features

5. **Security and Data Privacy in Frontend-Only Architecture**
   Mitigation: Client-side encryption for sensitive data, secure room code generation, clear privacy policies, no persistent sensitive data storage

6. **Network Reliability and Offline Scenarios**
   Mitigation: Implement robust reconnection logic, offline-first design patterns, local data caching, graceful degradation

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Serverless Backend Hybrid**: Use serverless functions (Vercel, Netlify) for minimal backend logic while maintaining frontend focus
2. **Blockchain-Based Coordination**: Utilize blockchain or distributed ledger for decentralized state management (high complexity)
3. **Browser Extension Architecture**: Build as a browser extension to access additional APIs and storage capabilities
4. **Desktop Application**: Use Electron to create a desktop app with more robust local networking capabilities
5. **Third-Party Integration Heavy**: Rely heavily on services like Firebase, Supabase, or AWS Amplify for backend-like functionality while keeping custom backend minimal
